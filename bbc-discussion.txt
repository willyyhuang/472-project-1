(a) what metric is best suited to this dataset/task and why (see step (2))

Accuracy should be the metric that is best suited to this dataset/task, 
because all the classes to be predicted are equally important and its number of instances are somewhat close for every class 
the number of articles related to business is 510 and the number of articles related to sport is 511.

(b) why the performance of steps (8-10) are the same or are different than those of step (7) above.

step 8 returns exactly the same result as the first try, as the training set is completely identical, therefore generates the same model.
as for step 9, it returns a slightly lower performance when evaluating accuracy, macro average and weighted average since the smoothing value is significantly different (0.0001 compared to 1.0).
for step 10, it returns exactly the same result as the first and second attempt since the default value is 1.0, 0.9 smoothing value is very close.
