Does the same model give you the same performance every time?

No, not all models give the same performance at each iteration of training.
The following models have the same performance at each iteration:
- Gaussian Naive Bayes with default parameters
- Decision Tree with default parameters
- Top-DT with the specific parameters
- Perceptron with default parameters

The only models that do not have same performance at each iteration based on 10 iterations are MLP and Top-MLP.
